# Randomized Breakout

### This is a game project built based on the Breakout arcade game.

### The catch is that every game is different. That includes the ball speed, the brick composition, and even the paddle's width.

### The game keeps track of your lives, current score, and high score throughout your games using Redux.

### You may use the arrow keys or the mouse to play.

### Oh and also, the bricks move from side to side as an added challenge.
